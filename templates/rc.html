        <h3>Deriving the Differential Equation and the General Solutionn</h3>
        <img src="/static\css\derivediffeq.png" alt="Derived Eq">
        <p>We start with the form at the very top. Since we are only concerned with discharge, our voltage, or the initial pushing force, is 0. The only change in the charge is therefore from the capacitor. This means the I or the current is dq/dt, change in charge of the capacitor. given the formula q=CV, so Vc is q/C. Vr = IR by ohm’s law. The derivation is attached below. Q is our initial value, and it has to be, since when t is 0, q(0) is the initial charge Q.
    </p>
    <p>Equilibrium is only for when Q is 0, which makes sense since the graph of the general solution tends to 0, and also dq/dt is 0 only if Q is 0. Charge in the capacitor also won’t go down if there is none to begin with.

        <h3>Limitations/Assumptions of the Model:</h3>
        <dl>
            <dt>Model is only applicable with DC Voltage values</li>
                <dd> - The current is flowing in one direction only</dd>
                <dd> - Voltage is a constant number</dd>
            <dt>The components of RC Circuits can be any arbitrary constant</dt>
                <dd> - Not defined as variables/functions</dd>
                <dd> - Except variable resistors (Potentiometers)</dd>
            <dt>Wired in series</dt>
                <dd> - Wiring in parallel would require different analysis techniques and the provided differential equation would not apply</dd>
            <dt>Capacitor has a max amount of voltage that it can hold before it begins to discharge it</dt>
                <dd> - Exceeding this voltage can lead to the capacitor exploding</dd>
                <dd> - We assume that the capacitor has reached its steady state while using this equation</dd>
            <dt>Assuming the circuit is completely ideal with no physical/external errors</dt>
